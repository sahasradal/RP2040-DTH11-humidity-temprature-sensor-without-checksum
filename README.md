# RP2040-DTH11-humidity-temprature-sensor-without-checksum
DTH11 data pin is connected to pin0 of RP2040. The RP040 pulls the pin0 low for 18ms to start communication. DTH11 responds back by pulling the line low for 80us and then high for another 80-100us. After this the DTH11 clocks out 40 low/high pair of data. 0bit is 50us low and 27us high. 1bit is 50us low and 70us high. In the code the low pulse duration and high pulse duration is measured and added to create time of 1 cycle. If the total duration is less than 100us it is considered as 0 and if above 100us it is considered as 1. All these data is shifted to a variable to create the final data. I am no getting proper check sum. looks like RP2040 measurement of signals in the range of micro seconds is not efficient and accurate.
